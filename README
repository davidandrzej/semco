OVERVIEW           

While the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2] model can be used to
automatically learn latent topics from text, the interpretability or
semantic coherence of these topics can vary considerably.  Mimno et al
[1] propose a topic semantic coherence score computed from in-corpus
word co-occurrence statistics, and show strong agreement with human
evaluations.  Given topics and text documents, this code calculates
semantic coherence scores for each topic.


EXAMPLE USAGE

The semantic-coherence takes as input a sequence of "Top N" string
sequences (the topics) and a sequence of document string sequences
(the corpus).

The return value is a sequence of {:topic :words :semco} maps, where
:topic is the numerical index (ie, where in the original input
sequence was this topic?), :words are the Top N topic words, and
:semco is the semantic coherence score calculated over the corpus.

(ns my-example
 (:use semco))

 (let [topics [["a" "b" "c"]
               ["x" "y" "z"]]
       docs [["a" "a" "a"]
             ["b" "c" "x" "z"]
             ["x" "x" "y" "z" "a"]]]
  (println "\n")
  (doseq [result (semantic-coherence topics docs)]
    (println (format "Topic %d = %s" (:topic result) (:words result)))
    (println (format "\tsemantic coherence = %f" (:semco result))))
  (println "\n"))

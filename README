semco - calculate topic semantic coherence scores as described in
Mimno et al (EMNLP 2011) [1]

OVERVIEW           

While the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2] model can be used to
automatically learn latent topics from text, the interpretability or
semantic coherence of these topics can vary considerably.  Mimno et al
[1] propose a topic semantic coherence score computed from in-corpus
word co-occurrence statistics, and show strong agreement with human
evaluations.  Given topics and text documents, this code calculates
semantic coherence scores for each topic.

This calculation is implemented in Clojure.  It should be relatively
straightforward to call this code from Java if desired.


EXAMPLE USAGE

(let [topic1 '("a" "b" "c")
      topic2 '("x" "y" "z")
      topics [topic1 topic2]
      docs  ['("a" "a" "a")
             '("b" "c" "x" "z")
             '("x" "x" "y" "z" "a")]]
 (println (str (semantic-coherence topics docs))))
